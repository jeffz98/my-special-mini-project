# CSS Snippet Cheatsheet: A Mini Project

## About The Project

This project was put together as a practice on HTML and CSS, but also for accessible information to some CSS Tricks useful for developers. As our first collaborative project in the UC Berkeley coding BootCamp, we faced timing and work distribution challenges. Work-wise, we focused on working mobile-first which brought challenges in responsiveness and use of media queries. For the placement of elements, we used flexbox for the first time which came with its own challenges in direction, growth, shrinks, and flex-basis. We used CSS transformation to give animation to our info cards so they move slightly up, vertically, when the user hovers over them. Finally, we implemented CSS variables to follow the DRY principle.

## Built With
